# DDRINQ: Data Driven Investments - Not Quantum
Our investment approach is rooted in data, not quantum computing

Our strategy involves scrutinizing over 500 securities to discern trends.
Signals are generated at the close of each trading day, becoming effective the subsequent trading day.
The chosen securities are characterized by volatility and high liquidity, with most trading at least one million shares daily.
Daily evaluations pinpoint potential securities for buy and sell actions based on predefined thresholds.

Simple mathematical models, complemented by a few more complex conditions, are employed to detect upward and downward trends.
It's important to note that while no guarantees are made, historical charts dating back to 2010 (or the security's addition date)
illustrate the effectiveness of our analysis over the past decade across all chosen securities.

The results indicate success over the long term for each individual security, even though specific trades may not always be profitable on their own.
To mitigate risks, diversification is strongly recommended both in terms of the number of securities held and the number of trades made.
This strategy helps neutralize the impact of sudden market spikes in either direction.

All executed trades are transparently displayed on our site.
The homepage offers detailed comparisons, showcasing the performance of holding a security for a year, trading based on conditions, and maintaining a diversified portfolio.
The Analysis page provides specific comparisons for each security, while the Buy and Sell pages outline potential conditions for the next trading day.

The annualized daily buy/sell return, along with the Delta from the execution price, is presented to offer comprehensive information.
Columns can be sorted by clicking, and filters can be applied to most fields.

The Last Transaction page reveals when the last conditions were met for each security, providing insights into recent and infrequent occurrences.
The Ticker page serves as the main hub, displaying annual returns, trade history since 2010, and price trends over the past 250 and 500 days.

The Brief page offers a condensed view of this information.
The ticker list box and accompanying option buttons allow users to filter by All, Buy, Sell, Held, and Wait categories.
Refresh times are conveniently displayed on the menu, occurring a few hours after market close.
