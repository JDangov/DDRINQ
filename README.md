Data Driven Investing - Not Quantum

500+ securities analyzed for trends.  Signals generated end of trade day which are effective the following trade day.
Securities chosen are volitile and most trade one million shares a day so they are very liquid.
Each day potential securities are identified for buy and sell and the threshold to meet.

If met, then the trades can be executed.

Simple math is used to detect upward and downward moving trends with a few more complex conditions.

No guarantees are made.  But, the charts show these securities back tested to 2010 or when they were added if after that point.
Results indicate that the analysis has worked over the past 10 years for all chosen securities (which is a fairly complete set).
Results indicate that the analysis works for each securities over time.  Individual trades may not be profitable on their own.
As such, and in all cases, one should diversify both in number of securities held and also in number of trades made.
This will help to remove the effects of spikes in either direction.

All trades are shown on the site.  Charts show comparison of holding the security for a year, trading that security when conditions are met,
and also a diversified portfolio where all securities satisfying the conditions are executed.

The Home page shows the comparisons in detail.  The Analysis page shows these same comparisons specific to a security.
The buy page shows the potential buy conditions for the next trade day.  The sell page shows the potential sells.
The annualized daily buy sell return is shown in the last column.  This and the Delta from the execution price should provide enough information.
Clicking on any column will sort that column.  One can also filter on most fields.

The Last Transaction page shows when the last conditions were met for each security.  Clicking on the date shows that many hit the prior day.
On the reverse end several haven't hit for years.

The Ticker page is the main page.  It shows the annual returns for that security as well as all trades since 2010.
The charts show the price trends for the past 250 and 500 days.  It also shows the returns for the past year and since 2010.
The last two charts show returns for buy and hold, buy/sell based on signals, and buy/sell for a fully diversified portfolio.
In some cases the individual security outperforms the fully diversified portfolio.  They almost always outperform the buy and hold strategy.
But, very different tax implications and buy/sell restrictions exist for some accounts.

The Brief page shows a subset of this information.

The ticker list box and the option buttons next to it let you filter the set: All, Buy, Sell, Held, and Wait.
Buy and Sell are the securities which are to be considered the next trade day.  Wait are the only ones not held or are not being considered to be bought.

The refresh time is shown to the right of the menu.  This should normally take place a few hours after market close.

Although these signals existed in the past, the cost of executing trades was prohibitive.  That cost has been lifted fairly recently.
